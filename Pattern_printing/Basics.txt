This Folder will contain the introduction related to patterns as
explained in this YT video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNm_NNSB3_w

This module will help to master Loops
***** They are not asked in interviews *****


Patterns -> We usually have Nester Loops.

1. For the outer loops, count the no. of lines
2. for the inner loops, focus on the columns & connect them somehow to
    the rows
3. Print them '*' inside the inner for loops
4. Observe Symmetry {optional}
